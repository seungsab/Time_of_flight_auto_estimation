# Piecewise Linear Regression via a Difference of Convex Functions

## Choose Your Destinty! Matlab or Python

This reepository provides a python implementation of our piecewise linear regression algorithm both with CPU and GPU.

The experiments that are shown in our paper are run with MATLAB which is a slower implementation than that of Python.
