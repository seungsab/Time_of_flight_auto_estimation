# Piecewise Linear Regression via a Difference of Convex Functions

## Prerequisites:
1. MATLAB version > 2016

2. Either of MATLAB optimization toolbox or gurobi integrated with MATLAB (much faster)

## Optional:
MATLAB Statistics and Machine learning Toolbox, Deep learning Toolbox. These are needed for KNN, SVM and MLP results.


## How to run?

### 1. Figure(1) code:
Run: "test_regression_toy.m"

### 2. Synthetic experiment code:
Run:  "test_regression_synthetic.m"

### 3. Regression experiment code:
Run:  "test_regression_real.m"

### 4. Multi class classification experiment code:
Run:  "test_multi_classification.m"
